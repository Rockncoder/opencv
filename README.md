## OpenCV C++ Development on Apple Silicon Macs using VS Code ##
*19 November 2023*

This is based on project is based on `Elliotcodes` YouTube video `How to Setup OpenCV for C++ on Visual Studio Code (MacOS)` https://youtu.be/Ozc3zWJ_NhQ?si=kJsDgmfhg79IAQvg. This project adds a few bits which make using OpenCV or any other modern C++ project easier on the Mac.

* It uses the still experimental but nonetheless excellent CMake extension for VS Code. (Version is 0.0.17 at time of writing)
    * CMake does all of the grunt work of finding libraries that you have installed. You don't have to create and configure `tasks.json` or `c_cpp_properties.json`.
* It includes a video and it is of me of course, talking about Android development in 2012.
